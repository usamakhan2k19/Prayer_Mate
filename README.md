Prayer-Mate (An AI-Powered Web App)
The Prayer-Mate project represents the culmination of extensive efforts to create an
innovative AI-powered web application aimed at enhancing the prayer experience for
Muslims. Comprising both frontend and backend components, the project leverages
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. A distinctive feature of the
project is the incorporation of a chat-bot emulating GPT-3.5.
